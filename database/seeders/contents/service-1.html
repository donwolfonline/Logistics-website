<strong class="font-md-bold color-grey-900 mb-25 d-block">Sea freight forwarding, also known as ocean freight
    forwarding, is a critical aspect of the global supply chain. It refers to the transportation of goods via cargo
    ships or vessels from one port to another. This mode of transportation is preferred by many businesses due to its
    cost-effectiveness, reliability, and ability to transport large quantities of goods. In this article, we will
    discuss the basics of sea freight forwarding, including its benefits, modes of transportation, and key
    players.</strong>
<h3 class="color-brand-2">Modes of Sea Freight Transportation</h3>
<p class="font-md color-grey-900">There are two primary modes of sea freight transportation: Full Container Load (FCL)
    and Less than Container Load (LCL). FCL is used when the shipment is large enough to fill an entire container. On
    the other hand, LCL is used when the shipment does not require a full container. In this case, the goods are
    combined with other shipments to fill a container. Both modes have their advantages and disadvantages.</p>

        <p>Cost-Effectiveness: Sea freight forwarding is one of the most cost-effective modes of transportation,
            especially for businesses that require the transportation of large quantities of goods. This is because
            cargo ships can transport large volumes of goods at a lower cost compared to other modes of
            transportation.</p>
        <p>Sea freight forwarding is a reliable mode of transportation since it is not affected by traffic or weather
            conditions. Additionally, cargo ships are designed to withstand harsh weather conditions, which reduces the
            risk of damage or loss of goods.</p>
